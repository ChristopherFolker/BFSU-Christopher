        <h2 style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>What is Spotify?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left:30px;">Spotify is a digital<span>&nbsp;</span>music streaming service<span>&nbsp;</span>that gives you access to millions of songs, podcasts and videos from artists all over the world, like<span>&nbsp;</span>Apple Music<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>Amazon Music Unlimited.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">Spotify<span>&nbsp;</span>is immediately appealing because you can access content for free by simply<span>&nbsp;</span>signing up using an email address<span>&nbsp;</span>or by<span>&nbsp;</span>connecting with Facebook. If you're not keen on monthly subscription fees for Spotify Premium, or just want to dip your toe in and test it out, it's easy to get started and there's no commitment.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>How does Spotify work?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">Getting started with listening to music on Spotify is easy:</p>
        <ol style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)">
        <li>Visit the<span>&nbsp;</span>Spotify website and sign-up. We'd recommend signing up with Facebook if you have an account as it'll make it easier to find and follow friends, see what they're listening to and share songs with them.</li>
        <li>Choose a<span>&nbsp;</span>subscription level. We'd recommend going for Spotify Premium as it gives you access to more features, is more flexible and will connect with more devices.</li>
        <li>Download and install the free Spotify application. There are versions for<span>&nbsp;</span>desktop<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>iPhone/iPad<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>Android phones.</li>
        <li>Sign into your account on those devices and get listening.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>Can you download music from Spotify?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">Yes and no. With Spotify Premium you can set music to be available "offline" but it's not the same as downloading music in the traditional sense. For example, you can't try to game the system by downloading an album then cancelling your subscription at a later date. And you can't download the tracks to burn them to a CD or copy them to other devices.</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">The idea of Spotify's offline mode is to allow you to have access to your favourite music when you're trying to save mobile data or travelling somewhere where access to the internet might not be easy.</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">With Spotify Premium you can have up to 10,000 songs available to listen to offline on up to five different devices. Downloading songs, albums or playlists on Spotify is simple too, which is great. Just switch the toggle next to Download on the album you'd like to download to listen offline. Alternatively, click the three dots in the top right and click "Download".</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>How much data does Spotify use?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">The amount of data that Spotify burns through will depend on the streaming quality you choose - more on this in a minute. This is a rough guide for how much data Spotify will get through:</p>
        <ul style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)">
        <li>One hour of music playback will use around 50MB of data when the quality is set to "normal".</li>
        <li>At normal quality you can play around 24 hours of music for around 1GB of data usage.</li>
        <li>At high-quality 1GB will be used in less than 15 hours.</li>
        <li>At extreme quality you'll use 1GB of data in 7 hours.</li>
        <li>You'll use a lot more data with video playback.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">You can check and change the quality of streaming and download of songs using mobile data in the settings on your device.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>High-quality streaming and audio quality</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">There are four different levels of streaming quality for Spotify. Streaming is all done in the Ogg Vorbis format and uses the following bitrates for each of the quality levels:</p>
        <ul style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)">
        <li>Low at 24kbps</li>
        <li>Normal streams at 96kbps</li>
        <li>High at 160kbps</li>
        <li>Very High streams at 320kbps</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">The quality level you use will depend on your preference and choices around data usage but it's worth noting that Very High is only available to Spotify Premium subscribers.</p>
        <br><br><br>


        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>Spotify Bluetooth connectivity</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">One of the obvious benefits of Spotify is if you're using it on your phone then you can connect to a wealth of different Bluetooth devices and stream your content that way. Whether that means a home audio receiver, head unit in your car, Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth-connected speaker - there's plenty of possibilities. With Spotify Premium you can also take advantage of Spotify Connect.</p>
        <br><br><br>


        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>How much is Spotify?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">Spotify comes in two main forms - free and Premium. Spotify Premium is&nbsp;&pound;9.99$9.99<span>&nbsp;</span>a month, which includes access to features such as ad-free streaming, unlimited skips, extreme quality streaming and Spotify Connect.</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">If multiple people in your house use Spotify, you might consider<span>&nbsp;</span>Premium for Family<span>&nbsp;</span>which gives up to six people access to their own unique Spotify account under one bill. All users have to live at the same address so it's not a package to include your friends on, but it's a good way to split the cost.</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">At &pound;14.99/$14.99,<span>&nbsp;</span>Premium for Family<span>&nbsp;</span>isn't too much extra over a standard Premium plan price, so it's a worthy investment.</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">For students, there's a discounted plan that costs just<span>&nbsp;</span>4.99/$4.99<span>&nbsp;</span>a month.&nbsp;</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966)"><strong>What is Spotify Time Capsule?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">Spotify regularly releases updates to its service to help improve your listening experience. This includes tailored playlists and discovery voyages to help you expand your musical horizons and find new artists you're likely to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">Sometimes though, they just add quirky&nbsp;lists which show how well they know you based on your current listening trends.&nbsp;Time Capsule is one example of this wizardry.</p>
        <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.966); padding-left: 30px;">This is a personalised playlist which picks out around 60 tracks that you would have listened to as you were growing up. It's a collection of throw-back songs that'll fill you with nostalgic joy. We found<span>&nbsp;</span>Time Capsule<span>&nbsp;</span>to be pretty accurate, scarily so in fact, but it obviously requires Spotify to have a good working knowledge of your musical taste, so get listening!</p>
